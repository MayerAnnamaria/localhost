1.#stop default apache
sudo apachectl stop
sudo launchctl unload -w /System/Library/LaunchDaemons/org.apache.httpd.plist 2>/dev/null

2.#install apache
brew install httpd

3.#start apache
brew services start httpd

4.#check in the browser window
http://localhost:8080

5.######Apache configuration!!!
subl /opt/homebrew/etc/httpd/httpd.conf
Listen 8080
->
Listen 80

6.#Search for the term DocumentRoot, and you should see the following line:
DocumentRoot "/opt/homebrew/var/www"
->
DocumentRoot "/Users/your_user/Sites"

7.#also change it to:
<Directory "/Users/your_user/Sites">

8.#In that same <Directory> block you will find an AllowOverride setting, this should be changed as follows:
AllowOverride None
->
AllowOverride All

9.#uncomment this:
LoadModule rewrite_module lib/httpd/modules/mod_rewrite.so

10.#change this
User your_user
Group staff

11.#change ServerName
#ServerName www.example.com:8080
->
ServerName localhost

12.#If you do not have it, then create Sites folder
mkdir ~/Sites
echo "<h1>My User Web Root</h1>" > ~/Sites/index.html

13.#Restart apache, check if all ok
brew services stop httpd
brew services start httpd

14.#check if url working
http://localhost

#TROUBLESHOOTING TIPS for apache:
#1. If you get a message that the browser can't connect to the server, first check to ensure the server is up.
#You should see a few httpd processes if Apache is up and running.
ps -aef | grep httpd

#2.Try to restart Apache
brew services restart httpd

#3. You can watch the Apache error log in a new Terminal tab/window during a restart to see if anything is invalid or causing a problem:
tail -f /opt/homebrew/var/log/httpd/error_log
#Meg lehet hasznalni:
brew services stop httpd
brew services start httpd
brew services restart httpd

#check where is apache installed
httpd -S

As you set up your .test virtual hosts, you may receive a warning such as 
Warning: DocumentRoot [/Users/your_user/Sites/grav-admin] does not exist when restarting Apache. 
This just lets you know that the source directory listed for your virtual hosts is not present on the drive. 
It's an issue that can be resolved by editing this file with the corrected DocumentRoot.
